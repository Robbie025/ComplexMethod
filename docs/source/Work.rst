Introduction
============

The Complex Method is an optimization algorithm and is based on the Simplex method. The complex method has been applied to a wide range of problems such as physics
, structural engineering, fluid power system design and aerospace engineering. The aim of the project is to make the complex method source code available to the general public. At the moment, the code is available in two implementations: python and matlab. 

Overview
--------

The documentation for the complexmethod is arranged as follows:

	3. **Software Prerequisites** will detail the software tools that are required to run the python and matlab codes. These include git, python with numpy, sphinx for documentation and Matlab. The terminal based installation given here are for ubuntu based systems. Nonetheless, the source code for python and matlab should work in mac and windows systems, provided the necessary packages are available. 
	4. **Complex Method -- Python** will describe the files that are included in the repository. Using examples for illustration, the included files can be used as templates for using the complex method in your own projects.

	#. **Complex Method -- Matlab** is a work in progress and will be updated in the near future.
	#. **Description** will describe the Complex optimization algorithm along with its variant, The complex-rf.
	
 



.. This chapter will detail the software tools needed to run the complex method algorithm. Currently, there are two implementations of the algorithm: 1. Python and 2, Matlab.

..  The section **Software** will detail the  software you must have in order to run the code as well as document the code as you see on this site.


..	1. *Git*
	2. *Python* with *Numpy*
	
	#. *Sphinx* for building the documentation
	#. *Matlab* to run the  ***.m files
