Here we document the work that has to be done and what has been completed. 
Mention this info in the commit log as well.


To Do list

. x-span termination criteria needs to be implemented. See the matlab code for reference .. high priority
. Number of complexrf runs  (see start.py ) needs to be multithreaded. low priority
. In start.py the oytput needs to be formatted nicely. Low priority 
. Code needs to be well commented.
. Many errors in the Description section like the references
. IDEA: make a table which shows different iterations, sort of as an example. For the documentation
. IDEA: can the documentation be more dynamic? readthedocs seems limited. People can optimize a problem online and view the process in a 3d plot.

Done & by whom
