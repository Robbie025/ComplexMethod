To Do list
*** Documentation on the Readthedocs have to be gitified and developed.
1. Need to have the x span implemented.
2. Need to have the initial checks in a seperate function
3. Number of complexrf runs  (see start.py ) needs to be multithreaded
4. For god sakes, make the output better in all manners
