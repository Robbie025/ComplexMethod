Mention this info in the commit log as well

. Number of complexrf runs  (see start.py ) needs to be multithreaded. low priority
. In start.py the oytput needs to be formatted nicely. Low priority 
. Code needs to be well commented. On going work. Needs to connect the documentation equation to the software implemenation. Needs to start with the matlab code as well.
. Many errors in the Description section like the references
. IDEA: make a table which shows different iterations, sort of as an example. For the documentation
. Can we have a website which can show an animation/plotting. Not hard wired, but live runs.
