To Do list
===========

Here we document the work that has to be done and what has been completed. 
Mention this info in the commit log as well

	1. Number of complexrf runs  (see start.py ) needs to be multithreaded. low priority
 	2. In start.py the output needs to be formatted nicely. 

	#. Code needs to be well commented. On going work. Needs to connect the documentation equation to the software implemenation. Needs to start with the matlab code as well.
	#. Many errors in the Description section like the references
	#. IDEA: make a table which shows different iterations, sort of as an example. For the documentation
	#. Can we have a website which can show an animation/plotting. Not hard wired, but live runs.



Completed along with the user resposible.
