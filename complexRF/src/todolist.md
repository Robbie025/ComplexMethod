To Do list
===========

Here we document the work that has to be done and what has been completed. 
Mention this info in the commit log as well

	1. Documentation to be completed. This is lacking now.  
 	2. Iterations and maxevaluations coould be in the argparam list. 

	#. IDEA: make a table which shows different iterations, sort of as an example. For the documentation
	#. Can we have a website which can show an animation/plotting. Not hard wired, but live runs.
